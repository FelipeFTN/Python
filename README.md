# Introduction

Some python projects that i have been working during my learning. That includes Games and Web Development.

## Python Projects

### Python Performance with Zig & Rust :zap:

This is very interesting!
I have created a simple function that calculates the Pi number using the Leibniz formula.
I have implemented this function in Python, Zig and Rust and compared the performance of each one.
Take a look at the results:

```bash
$ python3 main.py
🐍 Python: 20.275019s
⚡ Zig:    2.271423s
🦀 Rust:   0.484555s
```

### PyVelha • Tic Tac Toe made in Python :hash:

You may find this project in the folowing directory: `Python/Games/Jogo da Velha`
To run the game, you will need `numpy` you can get it using Pip by clicking [HERE](https://numpy.org/install/)
or running `pip install numpy`on your console.

### PyGame • Exploring the PyGame Module :space_invader:

This is a Pygame Library that I am using to explore the game development in Python.
No game was made yet, but I have some future projects that I will work on with python.

### Django • Some Django Framework projects :computer:

Probably the most difficult framework that I ever use in Python, you may find this project in the following directory: `Python/Django`
You can run using `python manage.py runserver`and it will open a new port `8000` in your localhost (127.0.0.1:8000).

### Virtual Assistant • Talking to my computer :sunglasses:

It's just a simple implementation of a voice recognition module in python to help me understanding some fundamentals.
